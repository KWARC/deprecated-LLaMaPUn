\title{Documentation of the LLaMaPUn C library}
\author{Jan Frederik Schaefer}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The LLaMaPUn C library contains some NLP tools for (mainly) mathematical documents.
This document is supposed to give an overview about these tools - both for users and
future developers of the library.

\section{Installation (on linux)}

You can clone the source from github:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/KWARC/LLaMaPUn.git
\end{lstlisting}
We will need a couple of libraries:
\begin{itemize}
\item Libxml2
\item LibJSON
\item uthash
\item libiconv
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{.travis.yml} file in the repository shows an example installation of the LLaMaPUn C library,
including the installation of these libraries with \texttt{apt-get}.

Since there are some issues with older versions of the JSON library,
you might want to run a small script to fix the includes, if necessary:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sh jsonincludecheck.sh > /dev/null
\end{lstlisting}
Now we can compile, test, and install the library, using \texttt{cmake}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}
